# flask-elrostick

## What?
it is a flask based webapp that allows to define neat names for Intertechno/Elro 433mhz switches and exposes them using mqtt for use with homeassistant/hassio.
It requires a arduino based 433mhz transmitter to work connected via usb
## Why?
when i switched to hassio i no longer could use my commandline_switch based aproach to swtich those outlets.
So i came up with this.
